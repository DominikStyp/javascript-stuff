# Facebook Hide Post
Imagine you're active user of facebook group where people post their favourite
tracks. Unfortunately you can't hide their posts on group site.
So there are lots of posts, and some and are back on top because someone has been commenting them recently, 
but you read them so you don't want to see them again.
*AND HERE'S A SOLUTION*: 
- Install Grease Monkey plugin to the Firefox
- Download *facebook-hide-post.js* 
- Paste *about:addons* in your browser
- Go to *User Scripts* tab
- Click *New script..."*
- Type *facebook* in name field, and hit *OK*
- Copy *facebook-hide-post.js* contents and paste it into opened editor window
  (remember that *@name facebook* must be the same as it is in the name field)
