In this branch I've preserved **cookie vs storage** functionality in Facebook Hide Post plugin.
On **gh-pages** (main branch) it's removed since all modern browsers support storage objects, so I've decided to remove it. But if somebody still want's to use old cookie version, checkout this branch.

# How to download and use ?
Every update will be added to the branch **gh-pages** because it's git's default branch for showing files as regular HTML pages.
If you pull this repo make sure that **gh-pages** brach is set.
You can use every project freely, but please do not remove author comments in scripts.
