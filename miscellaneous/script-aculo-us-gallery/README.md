# Script.aculo.us Gallery

# What is this ?
This is animated gallery of growing and moving images.<br />
When I've started my JavaScript programming career, I've wrote the following animated gallery.<br />
Script uses two external JavaScript libraries:<br />
- <a href="http://prototypejs.org/">Prototype</a>
- <a href="https://script.aculo.us/">Script.aculo.us</a>

# What it works ?
To present how gallery works I've used there couple of photos from the site: <a href="http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/photos/volcano-general">National Geographic</a><br />

# What you can setup ?
- Images in JavaScript array format with properties: desc (description), href (image source URL)
- Size of the miniatures that are loaded at the beginning
- Duration time of the animation
- Ids of the HTML elements where images are to be inserted

# How to use ?
Just <a href="http://dominikstyp.github.io/javascript-stuff/miscellaneous/script-aculo-us-gallery/script-aculo-us-gallery.html"> Try It! </a> and see for yourself.<br />
All you need is 2 files **script-aculo-us-gallery.html** along with **script-aculo-us-gallery.js**, no server, no database, no PHP nor any other server-side language is needed.<br />
It's pure JavaScript and HTML.

# Updates/Downloads
Every update will be added to the branch **gh-pages** because it's git's default branch for showing files as regular HTML pages.<br />
If you pull this repo make sure that **gh-pages** brach is set.

# Dependencies
**Following script is dependent on Prototype library **<br />
**It has global function which is constructor ScriptAculoUSGallery.**<br />

# Additional Info
This gallery obviously has lots of issues to improve. If you're interested in this code use it freely, and let me know if I can help with it's usage. <br />
If there is still somebody who doesn't use jQuery and is still sticked to the Prototype library, he may find it useful. <br />
This script may also be useful in educational purpose, if somebody wants to learn how to use Prototype/Script.aculo.us libs in creating galleries, animations etc.
