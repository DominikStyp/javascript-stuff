# If you looking for script that can:
- measure typing speed
- count typed words and chars
- define limit of words or chars in text
- show limit of words or chars

<br>**You've found all that in one script**

# What it does ?
Script **counts words (and chars) in text**, and also gives you **typing speed per second**.
It also **draws a bar** showing percentage of limit usage.
If you exceed limit, it will be shown as negative value of remaining chars, and more than 100% bar value.

# What you cat setup ?
- limit of words or chars that can be typed into textarea

- css can be freely changed

All you need is just type words into textarea field.
