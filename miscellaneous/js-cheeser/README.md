# JS Cheeser

# Wanna cheese somebody using JavaScript ?
Imagine you ask somebody to write his name, or something about himself into a HTML form, <br />
but what he will be typing - won't be the same what he sees on the screen! <br />
Remember movie **The Matrix**, and scene where Neo looks at the screen of his computer and sees strange text he didn't typed ? <br />
Wanna do something similar to cheese somebody using simple HTML Form ? <br />
Check out following script. <br />

# How to use ?
Just <a href="http://dominikstyp.github.io/javascript-stuff/miscellaneous/js-cheeser/js-cheeser.html"> Try It! </a> and see for yourself.<br />
All you need is 2 files **js-cheeser.html** along with **js-cheeser.js**, no server, no database, no PHP nor any other server-side language is needed.<br />
It's pure JavaScript and HTML. <br />
All you need is to download **js-cheeser** directory and run **js-cheeser.html** in your browser, and that's it.

# Dependencies
**Following script IS NOT dependent on any library, nor external sources.**<br />
**It has ONLY ONE global function which is its constructor.**<br />
**Everything else is contained in a closure, so it can't conflict with any library/script.**

# Updates/Downloads
Every update will be added to the branch **gh-pages** because it's git's default branch for showing files as regular HTML pages.<br />
If you pull this repo make sure that **gh-pages** brach is set.

# Additional Info
I've wrote this script some time ago to learn JavaScript **key press events** issues:
- how to capture key event values
- how to change what is currently typed
- how to regognize pressed keys
