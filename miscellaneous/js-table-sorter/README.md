# JavaScript Table Sorter

# If you looking for script that:
- can sort table in ascending or descending order
- is **very lightweight**
- doesn't require any external library
- is fastest as possible (written in pure JavaScript, used only it's internal methods)

<br>**You've found all that in one script**

# What it does ?
Javascript Table Sorter can sort simple HTML tables. <br />
User must only click a column header to trigger the sort, another click will reverse sorting order on that column (ascending/descending). <br />
User can also dynamically change the value of fields - this is mainly for testing purpose, but can can be used to dynamically change values in database <br />
if you want to integrate this with server-side application and dynamic admin interface.

# What you can setup ?
- css for the whole table
- turn on/off dynamic change of field values (by only clicking on the cells)

# How to use ?
Just <a href="http://dominikstyp.github.io/javascript-stuff/miscellaneous/js-table-sorter/js-table-sorter.html"> Try It! </a> and see for yourself.

# Updates/Downloads
Every update will be added to the branch **gh-pages** because it's git's default branch for showing files as regular HTML pages.
If you pull this repo make sure that **gh-pages** brach is set.

# Dependencies
**Following script IS NOT dependent on any library, nor external sources.**<br>
**It has ONLY ONE global function which is constructor JSTableSorter.**<br>
**Everything else is contained in a closure, so it can't conflict with any library/script.**
